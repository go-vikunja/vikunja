# TODO List for E2E Test Fixes

## Completed
- [x] Create PLAN.md and TODO.md files
- [x] Check GitHub CI logs for latest test failures
- [x] Analyze failing tests and root causes
- [x] Fix identified issues (undefined project ID bug in router)
- [x] Run linter, typecheck, unit tests
- [x] Commit and push changes

## Latest Issues Fixed (September 20, 2025)

### E2E Test Failures Analysis
The E2E tests were failing with these specific errors:
- **project-view-table.spec.ts**: Tasks not appearing in table view (2 failures)
- **overview.spec.ts**: Tasks not showing on home page overview (1 failure)
- **team.spec.ts**: Create button not found (1 failure)

### Root Cause: Unsafe Route Parameter Parsing
The main issue was in `frontend/src/router/index.ts` where `parseInt()` and `Number()` were being used directly on route parameters without validation. This could result in:
- `parseInt(undefined)` → `NaN`
- `NaN` being passed as projectId/viewId to components
- Components failing to load data due to invalid IDs

### Solution: Safe Parameter Parsing
Replaced all unsafe parameter parsing in the router with `getRouteParamAsNumber()` utility function:

**Files modified:**
- `frontend/src/router/index.ts`: Fixed all route prop parsing
- Routes affected: task detail, project views, project settings, filters

**The `getRouteParamAsNumber()` utility:**
- Returns `undefined` for invalid parameters instead of `NaN`
- Allows proper validation in components/composables
- Prevents malformed API requests

### Validation Added
- **useTaskList composable**: Already had guard to prevent loading with invalid projectId
- **TaskCollectionService**: Already had validation to throw errors for undefined projectIds
- **Router props**: Now safely convert parameters or return undefined

## Previous Issues Fixed
The E2E tests were also previously failing because API requests were being made to `/api/v1/projects/undefined/tasks` when the project ID was null or undefined.

**Previous Solutions**:
- Enhanced AbstractService.getReplacedRoute() to validate parameters
- Fixed AddTask.vue to properly validate route project ID
- Updated various components to use safer parameter utilities
- Fixed ProjectSettingsBackground.vue parameter validation

## Notes
- All lint, typecheck, and unit tests pass
- Changes committed and pushed successfully
- Router now safely handles undefined/invalid route parameters

## Current Status (September 20, 2025 - 5:17 PM)
**NEW CRITICAL FIX: ViewKind Type Conversion Issue Resolved!**

### Latest Fix - Project View Rendering Issue:
- **Problem**: E2E tests failing because `.tasks`, `.task`, `.tasktext` elements weren't being rendered
- **Root Cause**: Test factories creating project views with numeric `view_kind` (0,1,2,3) but frontend expecting string `viewKind` ('list','gantt','table','kanban')
- **Solution**: Added conversion logic in ProjectView model constructor to handle both formats
- **Files**: `src/models/projectView.ts`, test factories
- **Commits**: b84b09e92, cf08b9283

### All Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Project View Type Mismatch** - Component rendering issues due to viewKind format mismatch
2. ✅ **Subtask Relation Conflicts** - 409 errors in duplicate task relation tests
3. ✅ **Previous Router Issues** - Unsafe parameter parsing (from earlier sessions)
4. ✅ **Previous Button Issues** - Missing hasPrimaryAction props (from earlier sessions)

### Current GitHub Actions Status:
**From run 17881611285:** 7 total failing tests
- **Expected to be Fixed**: 3-4 tests (DOM rendering issues from viewKind mismatch)
- **Still investigating**: API intercept timeouts and notification issues

### Remaining Issues to Investigate:
- API route intercept timeout in project redirect test
- Success notification timing in project rename/delete tests

### All Static Analysis Passing:
- ✅ ESLint: No errors
- ✅ TypeScript: No type errors
- ✅ Unit tests: 690/690 passing
- ✅ Core issue with task list rendering should now be resolved

**Major progress made - the viewKind conversion fix should resolve the most critical DOM rendering issues affecting multiple test specs.**
