# Specification Quality Checklist: Saved Filters Regression Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT (user needs) not HOW (implementation)
- Technical context is separated into its own section for planning phase
- All sections use business-focused language

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 28 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (feature is well-understood from existing bug report)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 6 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
- 8 edge cases identified
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- All functional requirements map to user scenarios
- User scenarios are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria provide clear verification points
- Technical context provides implementation guidance without polluting the specification

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

This specification is complete and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality criteria are met.
