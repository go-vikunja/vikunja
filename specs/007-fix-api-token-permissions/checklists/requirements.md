# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix API Token Permissions System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 23, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation checks passed. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Summary:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification describes WHAT needs to be fixed (missing permission scopes) and WHY (users can't perform CRUD operations)
- No implementation details about Go code, Echo framework, or Vue.js components
- Written from user perspective (API token creators, API consumers)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- All functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking route registration)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (100% success rate, HTTP status codes)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., SC-001 focuses on "API tokens can create tasks" not "CollectRoute function must be called")
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear outcomes
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (duplicate routes, old tokens, dynamic parameters)
- Scope is bounded to fixing the permission registration system
- Dependencies identified (backward compatibility with existing tokens)

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance criteria
- User scenarios cover all priority levels (P1: core CRUD operations, P2: v2 consistency)
- Success criteria directly measure user story outcomes
- Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout
