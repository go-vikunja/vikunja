# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP HTTP/SSE Transport

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW:
- User stories describe business value (remote automation, deployment automation, backward compatibility)
- Functional requirements specify capabilities without mentioning TypeScript, Node.js, or specific libraries
- Success criteria measure user-facing outcomes (connection success, deployment time, performance)
- Language appropriate for business stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects have clear specifications
- All 30 functional requirements are testable with concrete acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include specific metrics (50 concurrent connections, 5-minute deployment, 80% cache hit rate)
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (invalid config, missing ports, token expiration, blue-green switches)
- Scope explicitly defined with P1/P2/P3 priorities and independent testability
- 10 documented assumptions covering infrastructure, compatibility, and operational constraints

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Feature parity verification (quantifiable: 100% tool compatibility)
- SC-002: Deployment time (quantifiable: under 5 minutes)
- SC-003: Concurrent connections (quantifiable: 50 connections, 500ms response time)
- SC-004: Cache effectiveness (quantifiable: 80% reduction in backend requests)
- SC-005: Zero regression (quantifiable: all tests pass)
- SC-006: Error detection (quantifiable: 100% error detection rate)
- SC-007: Zero downtime (quantifiable: no dropped connections during switch)
- SC-008: Fast failure (quantifiable: within 2 seconds)
- SC-009: Time to first connection (quantifiable: under 10 minutes)
- All criteria avoid implementation details - focus on outcomes

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase:
- 3 independent user stories with clear priorities (P1: HTTP core, P2: deployment, P3: backward compatibility)
- Each story can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Acceptance scenarios map to functional requirements
- 8 edge cases identified with clear resolution strategies
- Deployment integration explicitly scoped with specific script modifications
- Security requirements clearly defined (per-request auth, CORS, rate limiting)

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT - This spec demonstrates best practices:
1. **Prioritized user stories**: P1-P3 prioritization enables phased delivery with each phase providing standalone value
2. **Independent testability**: Each user story has explicit "Independent Test" section showing MVP viability
3. **Comprehensive edge cases**: 8 edge cases cover error scenarios, security, and operational concerns
4. **Clear assumptions**: 10 documented assumptions reduce ambiguity about infrastructure and dependencies
5. **Measurable success**: All 9 success criteria have concrete metrics or percentages
6. **No clarifications needed**: Spec is complete without any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` as no clarifications are required. The specification has sufficient detail for technical planning.
