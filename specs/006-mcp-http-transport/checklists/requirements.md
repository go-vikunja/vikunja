# Specification Quality Checklist: HTTP Transport for MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - All items verified:
- Specification uses business language throughout (e.g., "MCP clients", "authentication", "sessions")
- Technical stack mentioned only in Dependencies/Technical Prerequisites section (appropriate context)
- User scenarios focus on user goals and outcomes
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All items verified:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions have reasonable defaults in Assumptions)
- All 17 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- Success criteria are outcome-focused ("clients can establish connections in under 2 seconds" vs "API responds in 200ms")
- 5 user stories with clear acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- 7 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
- Scope section clearly defines in-scope and out-of-scope items
- 10 assumptions and comprehensive dependency list provided

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - All items verified:
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- User stories cover: remote connection (P1), protocol support (P1), authentication (P2), rate limiting (P3), session management (P3)
- 10 success criteria all measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation leakage detected in core specification (technologies properly scoped to Dependencies section)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and well-structured
- Free of ambiguities requiring clarification
- Focused on user outcomes and business value
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

## Notes

- Specification successfully balances clarity with flexibility
- Reasonable defaults documented for all potential ambiguities
- Technical prerequisites appropriately separated from requirements
- Edge cases comprehensive and well-considered
