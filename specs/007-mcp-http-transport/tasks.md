# Tasks: HTTP Transport for MCP Server

**Feature**: HTTP Transport for Vikunja MCP Server  
**Branch**: `007-mcp-http-transport`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-mcp-http-transport/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach - tests written FIRST before implementation per Constitution requirement

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single TypeScript project: `mcp-server/src/`, `mcp-server/tests/`
- Deployment: `deploy/proxmox/`
- Documentation: Root level files (README, CHANGELOG)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational - HIGHEST PRIORITY
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after US1 complete (builds on HTTP infrastructure)
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
  - User Story 4 (Phase 6): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
  - User Story 5 (Phase 7): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
- **Deployment (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 minimum (MVP), ideally US1+US2 complete
- **Documentation (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core HTTP Streamable transport - NO dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: SSE transport - Depends on US1 infrastructure but can be developed in parallel after T021
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Enhanced authentication - Independent, can start after Foundational
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Rate limiting - Independent, can start after Foundational
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Session management - Independent, can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

**Standard TDD Flow** (per Constitution):
1. Write tests FIRST (tasks with test files)
2. Verify tests FAIL (run test suite)
3. Implement feature (tasks with src/ files)
4. Verify tests PASS (checkpoint tasks)
5. Refactor if needed (keep tests green)

**Task Order within Story**:
- Tests before implementation
- Core infrastructure before integrations
- Happy path before edge cases
- Implementation before verification

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)**: Tasks T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel

**Foundational (Phase 2)**: Tasks T008, T009, T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel after T006-T007

**User Story 1 Tests**: Tasks T015, T016, T017 can run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 2**: Can start in parallel with US3/US4/US5 after US1 T021 complete

**User Story 3 Tests**: Tasks T038, T039 can run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 3-5**: Can all proceed in parallel after Foundational complete (if team capacity allows)

**Deployment**: Tasks T064, T070 can run in parallel

**Documentation**: Tasks T071, T072, T073, T074, T075 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests (TDD Phase)

```bash
# Launch all test creation for User Story 1 together:
Task T015: "Create mcp-server/tests/transports/http-streamable.test.ts"
Task T016: "Create mcp-server/tests/auth/token-validator.test.ts"
Task T017: "Create mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts"

# All can be written in parallel (different files)
```

### Parallel Example: Foundational Infrastructure

```bash
# After config setup (T006-T007), launch in parallel:
Task T008: "Create mcp-server/src/auth/token-validator.ts"
Task T009: "Create mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.ts"
Task T010: "Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/limiter.ts"
Task T011: "Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/redis-store.ts"
Task T012: "Create mcp-server/src/transports/http/session-manager.ts"

# All different files, no dependencies between them
```

### Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# After Foundational complete, with 3 developers:
Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - HTTP Streamable core
Developer B: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Enhanced authentication  
Developer C: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - Rate limiting

# US2 should follow US1 due to infrastructure dependencies
# US5 can also proceed in parallel (session management)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 Only)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T005) - ~1 hour
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (T006-T014) - ~4 hours
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T015-T028) - ~8 hours
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test HTTP Streamable independently
4. **Complete Phase 4**: User Story 2 (T029-T037) - ~4 hours
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both transports work
5. **Deploy & Demo**: Basic HTTP transport functional

**MVP Deliverables**: Remote HTTP connection, HTTP Streamable + SSE transports, basic authentication, tool execution

---

### Full Feature (All User Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (as above)
2. Complete User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently
3. Complete User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently

---

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With 3 developers**:

1. **Week 1**: All developers complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T014)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T015-T028) - HTTP Streamable core
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T029-T037) - SSE transport (starts after A completes T021)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T038-T047) - Enhanced auth (parallel with A/B)
3. **Week 3**: 
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (T048-T054) - Rate limiting
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (T055-T063) - Session management
   - **Developer C**: Deployment (T064-T070)
4. **Week 4**: All developers on Documentation & Testing (T071-T081)

---

## Test Coverage Target

Per Constitution requirement: **80%+ coverage for HTTP transport code**

**Coverage areas**:
- `src/auth/` - token validation, middleware (80%+)
- `src/ratelimit/` - rate limiting logic (80%+)
- `src/transports/http/` - HTTP Streamable, SSE, session management (80%+)
- `src/config/schema.ts` - config validation (80%+)

**Exclusions** (don't need coverage):
- External dependencies (Vikunja API client calls - use mocks)
- Main entry point boilerplate (index.ts)
- Logger initialization

**Verification**: Task T076 runs `pnpm test:coverage` and confirms 80%+ achieved

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories (US1-US5) for traceability
- **TDD mandatory**: Per Constitution, write tests FIRST, watch them FAIL, then implement
- **Independent stories**: Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Checkpoint validation**: Stop at checkpoints to verify story independently
- **Coverage gates**: Must achieve 80%+ coverage before considering story complete
