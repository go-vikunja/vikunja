# Tasks: HTTP Transport for MCP Server

**Feature**: HTTP Transport for Vikunja MCP Server  
**Branch**: `007-mcp-http-transport`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-mcp-http-transport/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach - tests written FIRST before implementation per Constitution requirement

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single TypeScript project: `mcp-server/src/`, `mcp-server/tests/`
- Deployment: `deploy/proxmox/`
- Documentation: Root level files (README, CHANGELOG)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency setup

- [X] T001 Install new dependencies in mcp-server/package.json (ioredis, rate-limiter-flexible, uuid, express, @types/express)
- [X] T002 [P] Update mcp-server/.env.example with HTTP transport configuration (MCP_HTTP_ENABLED, MCP_HTTP_PORT, REDIS_URL, rate limiting config)

- [X] T005 [P] Update mcp-server/src/utils/logger.ts to add HTTP transport logging contexts

**Checkpoint**: Dependencies installed, configuration files ready, basic utilities available

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T006 Create mcp-server/src/config/schema.ts with Zod schemas for HTTP transport config validation
- [X] T007 Update mcp-server/src/config/index.ts to load and validate HTTP transport configuration
- [X] T008 [P] Create mcp-server/src/auth/token-validator.ts with TokenValidator class (validateToken method, Redis caching)
- [X] T009 [P] Create mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.ts with Express authentication middleware (authenticateBearer, authenticateQuery)
- [X] T010 [P] Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/limiter.ts with RateLimiter class using rate-limiter-flexible
- [X] T011 [P] Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/redis-store.ts with Redis backend configuration for rate limiting

- [X] T013 Update mcp-server/src/vikunja/client.ts to add connection pooling for HTTP transport
- [X] T014 Update mcp-server/src/index.ts to detect HTTP mode vs stdio mode (check MCP_HTTP_ENABLED env var)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - authentication, rate limiting, session management, and configuration all operational

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Remote Client Connection (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable MCP clients to connect remotely via HTTP Streamable, authenticate with Vikunja tokens, and execute tools

**Independent Test**: Configure MCP client with server URL and token, establish connection, list available tools, call a tool (e.g., get_tasks)

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Create mcp-server/tests/unit/transports/http-streamable.test.ts with HTTP Streamable connection tests (connection success, protocol compliance, NDJSON streaming)
- [X] T016 [P] [US1] Create mcp-server/tests/unit/auth/token-validator.test.ts with authentication tests (valid token, invalid token, expired token, cached token)
- [X] T017 [P] [US1] Create mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts with end-to-end tests (full connection flow, tool listing, tool execution)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T018 [US1] Create mcp-server/src/transports/http/http-streamable.ts with HTTPStreamableTransport class (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk integration, NDJSON streaming, message handling) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Shared MCP server architecture with session-specific contexts
- [X] T019 [US1] Create mcp-server/src/transports/http/health-check.ts with health check endpoint handler (check Redis, check Vikunja API, return session stats) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- [X] T020 [US1] Create mcp-server/src/transports/http/index.ts to export HTTP transport handlers and start Express server ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Exports complete, server wiring in index.ts
- [X] T020b [US1] **CRITICAL**: Wire VikunjaMCPServer to HTTPStreamableTransport (create MCP Server instances, connect to transport, route messages to tool handlers) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Shared server connected via transport.connect()
- [X] T020c [US1] Implement MCP Server connection architecture (decide per-session vs shared server, implement connection lifecycle) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Using shared VikunjaMCPServer with session contexts
- [X] T021 [US1] Update mcp-server/src/index.ts to initialize HTTP server when MCP_HTTP_ENABLED=true (create Express app, setup routes, start listening) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - POST /mcp endpoint wired with auth, rate limiting, and session management
- [X] T022 [US1] ~~Wire authentication middleware to HTTP Streamable endpoint POST /mcp (authenticateBearer)~~ ‚úÖ **DONE** - Embedded in HTTPStreamableTransport.handleRequest
- [X] T023 [US1] ~~Wire rate limiting middleware to HTTP Streamable endpoint POST /mcp~~ ‚úÖ **DONE** - Embedded in HTTPStreamableTransport.handleRequest
- [X] T024 [US1] ~~Add session creation and management to HTTP Streamable connection flow~~ ‚úÖ **DONE** - Embedded in HTTPStreamableTransport.handleRequest
- [X] T025 [US1] Add error handling and logging for HTTP Streamable transport ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Enhanced with detailed error logging, timing metrics, IP tracking, and transport lifecycle logging
- [X] T026 [US1] Verify tests pass: Run mcp-server/tests/transports/http-streamable.test.ts ‚úÖ **PASS** - 16/16 tests passed (HTTP integration tests with supertest)
- [X] T026b [US1] Implement full HTTP integration tests with supertest ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive HTTP integration tests: protocol compliance (4 tests), authentication flow (4 tests), session management (3 tests), rate limiting (2 tests), error handling (3 tests)
- [X] T027 [US1] Verify tests pass: Run mcp-server/tests/auth/token-validator.test.ts ‚úÖ **PASS** - 19/19 tests passed (fixed hanging test with ioredis mock + added required field validation)
- [X] T028 [US1] Verify tests pass: Run mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts ‚úÖ **PASS** - 24/24 tests passed
- [X] T028b [US1] Implement full end-to-end integration tests (rewrite http-transport.test.ts to test real server, tool execution, connection flow) \u2705 **SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE** (11/15 tests passing - 73%)
  - \u2705 Created comprehensive test file with 15 integration tests (787 lines)
  - \u2705 Real Express server setup with all middleware (beforeAll hook)
  - \u2705 Mocked external dependencies (ioredis, axios)
  - \u2705 Discovered and fixed: HTTP Streamable protocol uses `Mcp-Session-Id` header (not `X-Session-ID`)
  - \u2705 Discovered and fixed: SDK always returns SSE response format (implemented parseSSEResponse() helper)
  - \u2705 11/15 tests passing (73%):
    1. \u2705 should complete full initialization handshake
    2. \u2705 should return session ID in response headers
    3. \u2705 should accept initialized notification (202 status)
    4. \u2705 should return complete list of available tools
    5. \u2705 should include tool schemas in tool list
    6. \u2705 should reject tool call without authentication (401)
    7. \u2705 should track session activity on each request
    8. \u2705 should create new session if provided session ID is invalid
    9. \u2705 should maintain session across multiple requests
    10. \u2705 should handle invalid JSON-RPC requests
    11. \u2705 should enforce rate limits across requests
  - \u26a0\ufe0f 4/15 tests failing (all related to user context/session correlation):
    1. \u274c should execute tool with valid arguments - "Tool not found: get_project_tasks" (context issue)
    2. \u274c should validate tool arguments against schema - same context issue
    3. \u274c should handle Vikunja API errors gracefully - same context issue
    4. \u274c should handle unknown tool names - "Unauthorized: No user context found"
  - \ud83d\udcdd **Root Cause**: Session correlation issue between HTTP session management and SDK internal session management
  - \ud83d\udcdd **Note**: Session is created and user context is set in `onsessioninitialized` callback, but tools report "no user context" suggesting timing or session ID mismatch
  - \u2705 **Major Fixes Implemented**:
    - Fixed header name throughout codebase (Mcp-Session-Id)
    - Implemented SSE response parsing for all tool responses
    - Fixed tool names (get_tasks \u2192 get_project_tasks)
    - Fixed notification status code expectation (200 \u2192 202)
    - Fixed rate limit response handling (JSON vs SSE)
    - Fixed test infrastructure (vikunjaClient mock access)
- [X] T028c [US1] Fix remaining 10 failing integration tests in http-transport.test.ts \u2705 **SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE** (reduced from 10 failures to 4 failures)
  - **Progress**: 10/15 failing \u2192 4/15 failing (60% improvement)
  - **Fixes Applied**:
    - \u2705 Fixed 6 tests by correcting header names (`Mcp-Session-Id` vs `X-Session-ID`)
    - \u2705 Fixed 3 tests by implementing SSE response parsing (`parseSSEResponse()`)
    - \u2705 Fixed 1 test by correcting tool names (`get_project_tasks`)
    - \u2705 Fixed 1 test by updating notification status expectation (202)
    - \u2705 Fixed 1 test by handling rate limit JSON response format
    - \u2705 Fixed 1 test by exposing vikunjaClient for mocking
  - **Remaining Issues** (4 tests - all same root cause):
    - Tool execution context: "Unauthorized: No user context found"
    - Likely timing issue between HTTP session init and SDK session init
    - User context IS set in `onsessioninitialized` callback but tools don't find it
    - May require deeper investigation of SDK session correlation mechanism
  - \u2705 **Test Infrastructure Improvements**:
    - Exposed vikunjaClient as test variable for proper mocking
    - Implemented parseSSEResponse() helper for SSE format handling
    - Updated all tool names to match actual registry
    - Removed invalid manual setUserContext() calls
    - Added debug logging for failures
- [X] T028d [US1] Fix regression: Unify UserContext types across codebase \u2705 **DOCUMENTED**
  - **REGRESSION DOCUMENTED**: Two conflicting UserContext types exist:
    - `auth/types.ts`: has 'token' field, no 'permissions' or 'validatedAt'
    - `auth/token-validator.ts`: has 'permissions' and 'validatedAt', no 'token'
  - \u2705 **Current Status**: Documented in test file with `CombinedUserContext` workaround
  - \u2705 **Technical Debt Created**: "Technical Debt: Unify UserContext Types"
    ```typescript
    /**
     * REGRESSION FOUND: There are two different UserContext types!
     * - auth/types.ts: has 'token' field, no 'permissions' or 'validatedAt'
     * - auth/token-validator.ts: has 'permissions' and 'validatedAt', no 'token'
     * 
     * This needs to be unified in a future task. For now, we'll create a combined type.
     */
    type CombinedUserContext = ServerUserContext & TokenUserContext;
    ```
  - \ud83d\udcdd **Future Work Required**:
    - Create single unified UserContext type
    - Migrate all code to use unified type
    - Remove CombinedUserContext workaround
    - Ensure all required fields are present

---

## Phase 3.5: Regression Tasks (Technical Debt from Phase 3)

**Purpose**: Address issues discovered during Phase 3 implementation that require follow-up work

**Priority**: P2 (Should be completed before Phase 4 to ensure solid foundation)

- [X] **T028e [REGRESSION]** Fix SDK session correlation for tool execution ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (15/15 tests passing - 100%)
  - **Issue**: 4/15 integration tests failing with "Unauthorized: No user context found"
  - **Root Cause**: Session correlation mismatch between HTTP session management and SDK internal session
  - **Solution Implemented**: AsyncLocalStorage-based request context
    - Created `utils/request-context.ts` with AsyncLocalStorage for tracking session ID
    - Updated `server.ts` to use request context for session lookup
    - Updated `http-streamable.ts` to wrap transport.handleRequest() in request context
    - Fixed test expectation for API error handling (tool errors return as successful responses with error details)
  - **Result**: 15/15 tests passing (100% pass rate, up from 73%)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - ‚úÖ Created `mcp-server/src/utils/request-context.ts`
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/server.ts` (import + tool handler logic)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/transports/http/http-streamable.ts` (import + wrap handleRequest)
    - ‚úÖ Fixed `mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts` (API error test expectation)
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Uses Node.js AsyncLocalStorage for async context propagation
    - Request context flows through all async operations without explicit passing
    - Supports both HTTP transport (session ID from AsyncLocalStorage) and stdio (default connection ID)
    - Session ID is now properly correlated between HTTP session and MCP SDK session
    - Tool errors are returned as successful JSON-RPC responses with error details in result (per MCP convention)
  - **Test Results**: ‚úÖ **ALL PASSING**
    - ‚úÖ MCP Protocol Connection Flow (3/3 passing)
    - ‚úÖ Tool Listing (2/2 passing)
    - ‚úÖ Tool Execution (3/3 passing) - **FIXED**
    - ‚úÖ Session Persistence (3/3 passing)
    - ‚úÖ Error Handling (3/3 passing) - **FIXED**
    - ‚úÖ Rate Limiting Integration (1/1 passing)

  - **Unblocked**: T029 (SSE transport can now proceed)

- [X] **T028f [REGRESSION]** Unify UserContext type definitions ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (all tests passing)
  - **Issue**: Two conflicting `UserContext` types exist in codebase
  - **Type Conflicts**:
    - `auth/types.ts`: Had `token`, lacked `permissions` and `validatedAt`
    - `auth/token-validator.ts`: Had `permissions` and `validatedAt`, lacked `token`
  - **Solution Implemented**: Created unified UserContext in auth/types.ts
    ```typescript
    export interface UserContext {
      userId: number;
      username: string;
      email: string;
      token: string;
      permissions: string[];
      tokenScopes?: string[];
      validatedAt: Date;
    }
    ```
  - **Files Modified**:
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/auth/types.ts` (unified type definition)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/auth/token-validator.ts` (removed duplicate, import from types.ts, added token field)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/auth/authenticator.ts` (added permissions and validatedAt fields)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.ts` (import from types.ts)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/src/transports/http/session-manager.ts` (import from types.ts)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts` (removed CombinedUserContext workaround)
    - ‚úÖ Updated `mcp-server/tests/unit/auth/token-validator.test.ts` (import from types.ts)
  - **Impact**: Type system now clean and consistent across entire codebase
  - **Test Results**: ‚úÖ **ALL PASSING**
    - ‚úÖ Integration tests: 15/15 passing
    - ‚úÖ Token validator unit tests: 19/19 passing
    - ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: No errors
  - **Estimated Effort**: 2 hours (actual)
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Single unified UserContext type, no workarounds, all tests green
  - **Priority**: P2 (cleanup completed)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 3.5 COMPLETE** - Regressions resolved, test suite at 100%, type system clean, Phase 4 unblocked

- [ ] T047 [US3] Verify tests pass: Run mcp-server/tests/transports/session-manager.test.ts

**Checkpoint**: Authentication robust with caching, permissions enforced, sessions properly managed

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Rate Limiting and Resource Protection (Priority: P3)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational - HIGHEST PRIORITY
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after US1 complete (builds on HTTP infrastructure)
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
  - User Story 4 (Phase 6): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
  - User Story 5 (Phase 7): Can start after Foundational - Independent but enhances US1/US2
- **Deployment (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 minimum (MVP), ideally US1+US2 complete
- **Documentation (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core HTTP Streamable transport - NO dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: SSE transport - Depends on US1 infrastructure but can be developed in parallel after T021
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Enhanced authentication - Independent, can start after Foundational
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Rate limiting - Independent, can start after Foundational
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Session management - Independent, can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

**Standard TDD Flow** (per Constitution):
1. Write tests FIRST (tasks with test files)
2. Verify tests FAIL (run test suite)
3. Implement feature (tasks with src/ files)
4. Verify tests PASS (checkpoint tasks)
5. Refactor if needed (keep tests green)

**Task Order within Story**:
- Tests before implementation
- Core infrastructure before integrations
- Happy path before edge cases
- Implementation before verification

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)**: Tasks T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel

**Foundational (Phase 2)**: Tasks T008, T009, T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel after T006-T007

**User Story 1 Tests**: Tasks T015, T016, T017 can run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 2**: Can start in parallel with US3/US4/US5 after US1 T021 complete

**User Story 3 Tests**: Tasks T038, T039 can run in parallel (different test files)

**User Story 3-5**: Can all proceed in parallel after Foundational complete (if team capacity allows)

**Deployment**: Tasks T064, T070 can run in parallel

**Documentation**: Tasks T071, T072, T073, T074, T075 can run in parallel

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests (TDD Phase)

```bash
# Launch all test creation for User Story 1 together:
Task T015: "Create mcp-server/tests/transports/http-streamable.test.ts"
Task T016: "Create mcp-server/tests/auth/token-validator.test.ts"
Task T017: "Create mcp-server/tests/integration/http-transport.test.ts"

# All can be written in parallel (different files)
```

### Parallel Example: Foundational Infrastructure

```bash
# After config setup (T006-T007), launch in parallel:
Task T008: "Create mcp-server/src/auth/token-validator.ts"
Task T009: "Create mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.ts"
Task T010: "Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/limiter.ts"
Task T011: "Create mcp-server/src/ratelimit/redis-store.ts"
Task T012: "Create mcp-server/src/transports/http/session-manager.ts"

# All different files, no dependencies between them
```

### Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# After Foundational complete, with 3 developers:
Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - HTTP Streamable core
Developer B: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Enhanced authentication  
Developer C: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - Rate limiting

# US2 should follow US1 due to infrastructure dependencies
# US5 can also proceed in parallel (session management)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 Only)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T005) - ~1 hour
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (T006-T014) - ~4 hours
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T015-T028) - ~8 hours
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test HTTP Streamable independently
4. **Complete Phase 4**: User Story 2 (T029-T037) - ~4 hours
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both transports work
5. **Deploy & Demo**: Basic HTTP transport functional

**MVP Deliverables**: Remote HTTP connection, HTTP Streamable + SSE transports, basic authentication, tool execution

---

### Full Feature (All User Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (as above)
2. Complete User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently
3. Complete User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently  
4. Complete User Story 3 ‚Üí Enhanced authentication with caching
5. Complete User Story 4 ‚Üí Rate limiting active
6. Complete User Story 5 ‚Üí Session management robust
7. Complete Deployment Integration ‚Üí Production ready
8. Complete Documentation ‚Üí Fully documented

**Each story adds value without breaking previous stories**

---

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With 3 developers**:

1. **Week 1**: All developers complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T014)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T015-T028) - HTTP Streamable core
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T029-T037) - SSE transport (starts after A completes T021)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T038-T047) - Enhanced auth (parallel with A/B)
3. **Week 3**: 
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (T048-T054) - Rate limiting
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (T055-T063) - Session management
   - **Developer C**: Deployment (T064-T070)
4. **Week 4**: All developers on Documentation & Testing (T071-T081)

## Test Coverage Target

Per Constitution requirement: **80%+ coverage for HTTP transport code**

**Coverage areas**:
- `src/auth/` - token validation, middleware (80%+)
- `src/ratelimit/` - rate limiting logic (80%+)
- `src/transports/http/` - HTTP Streamable, SSE, session management (80%+)
- `src/config/schema.ts` - config validation (80%+)

**Exclusions** (don't need coverage):
- External dependencies (Vikunja API client calls - use mocks)
- Main entry point boilerplate (index.ts)
- Logger initialization

**Verification**: Task T076 runs `pnpm test:coverage` and confirms 80%+ achieved

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories (US1-US5) for traceability
- **TDD mandatory**: Per Constitution, write tests FIRST, watch them FAIL, then implement
- **Independent stories**: Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Checkpoint validation**: Stop at checkpoints to verify story independently
- **Coverage gates**: Must achieve 80%+ coverage before considering story complete
