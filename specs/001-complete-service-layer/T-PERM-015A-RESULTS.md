- tasks_test.go (17 structure tests - KEEP)
- Others to be evaluated

### Helper Function Verification ✅

All 5 temporary helpers added in T-PERM-015 verified:

1. ✅ **GetSavedFilterSimpleByID** - No compilation errors
2. ✅ **GetLinkSharesByIDs** - No compilation errors
3. ✅ **GetProjectViewByIDAndProject** - No compilation errors
4. ✅ **GetProjectViewByID** - No compilation errors
5. ✅ **GetTokenFromTokenString** - No compilation errors

**Verification**: `go test -c ./pkg/models` succeeds ✅

## T-PERM-016 Execution Plan

Based on T-PERM-015A audit results:

### Phase 1: Delete Permission-Only Files (2 hours)
**Action**: Delete entire files (permission tests only, no structure tests)

Files to delete:
- bulk_task_test.go (1 call)
- project_users_permissions_test.go (6 calls)
- teams_permissions_test.go (8 calls)

**Impact**: 15 permission calls removed

### Phase 2: Delete Permission Tests from Mixed Files (3 hours)
**Action**: Delete permission test functions, keep structure tests

Files to refactor:
- api_tokens_test.go (delete 3 permission tests, keep 1 structure test)
- task_relation_test.go (delete 7 permission tests, keep 0 - DELETE FILE)

**Impact**: 10 permission calls removed

### Phase 3: Refactor Major Files (3 hours)
**Action**: Extract structure tests, delete permission tests, update DB usage

Files to refactor:
- main_test.go (10 permission calls, 2 structure tests)
- project_test.go (3 permission calls, 17 structure tests)
- saved_filters_test.go (14 permission calls, 6 structure tests)
- subscription_test.go (12 permission calls, 12 structure tests)
- task_attachment_test.go (8 permission calls, 10 structure tests)
- task_comments_test.go (2 permission calls, 8 structure tests)

**Impact**: 49 permission calls removed

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Validation (1 hour)
**Action**: Remove temporary helpers, validate tests

- Remove 5 helper functions from main_test.go
- Verify service tests still pass (compare against baseline)
- Document final state

**Total Time Estimate**: 1 day (8 hours)  
**Total Permission Calls Removed**: 74

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ LOW RISK Areas

1. **Service Layer Stability**: 
   - 283/283 tests passing
   - 6/6 baseline tests passing
   - Can detect regressions immediately

2. **Clear Categorization**:
   - 11 files clearly identified for deletion/refactor
   - No guesswork needed

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - All verified working
   - No compilation issues

4. **Production Code**:
   - Unaffected by model test changes
   - Compiles successfully

### ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK Areas

1. **Large File Refactoring**:
   - main_test.go has 44 DB operations
   - May need careful refactoring

2. **Structure Test Preservation**:
   - Some files have valuable structure tests
   - Must not accidentally delete

**Mitigation**: 
- Follow categorization strictly
- Verify compilation after each file
- Compare service tests against baseline

---

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:

- ✅ Service tests: 100% passing (baseline documented)
- ✅ Model test audit: All 74 calls documented
- ✅ Test categorization: All files categorized
- ✅ Helper functions: Verified working
- ✅ Production code: Compiles successfully
- ✅ Baseline tests: 6/6 passing
- ✅ Clear roadmap for T-PERM-016

---

## Recommendations for T-PERM-016

1. **Execute in Phases**: Follow the 4-phase plan above
2. **Verify After Each Phase**: Run `go test -c ./pkg/models` after each file change
3. **Preserve Structure Tests**: Keep tests from task_collection_filter_test.go, teams_test.go, tasks_test.go
4. **Compare Against Baseline**: After completion, re-run service tests and compare against `/tmp/service_tests_baseline.txt`
5. **Document Changes**: Update T-PERM-016 task with actual results

---

## Files to Preserve

Based on audit, these files have high-value structure tests (KEEP):

1. **task_collection_filter_test.go** - 78 structure tests (filter logic)
2. **teams_test.go** - 12 structure tests (team validation)
3. **tasks_test.go** - 17 structure tests (task validation)
4. **label_test.go** - 1 structure test (label validation)
5. **reaction_test.go** - 1 structure test (reaction validation)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **T-PERM-015A Complete** - Baseline established, audit complete
2. ⏳ **T-PERM-016 Ready** - Execute with confidence using this roadmap
3. After T-PERM-016: Compare service tests against baseline to ensure no regressions
