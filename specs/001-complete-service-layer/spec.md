## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What should be the resolution strategy when validation reveals differences between original and refactored systems? → A: Original system behavior takes precedence (refactor must match exactly)
- Q: What is the minimum required uptime during the stabilization phase? → A: Development environment only (no uptime requirements)
- Q: What should determine the prioritization sequence for refactoring the remaining features during Phase 2? → A: Dependency, then Complexity
- Q: What should be the minimum test coverage threshold specifically for the refactored service layer components? → A: Higher standard for new services (90% backend)
- Q: Who should be responsible for the final architectural validation? → A: AI review + Human final approval

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a software architect completing a critical service-layer refactor, I need a comprehensive three-phase plan that systematically stabilizes the current partially-refactored codebase, completes the remaining refactor work, and validates that the final result is functionally identical to the original working system while maintaining architectural excellence.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Phase 1: Full System Stabilization**
1. **Given** a partially-refactored codebase with failing tests and UI bugs, **When** the stabilization phase is executed, **Then** all backend tests pass, all UI functionality works correctly, and the system operates with 100% stability.

2. **Given** failing task-related tests showing missing data relationships, **When** service layer implementations are corrected, **Then** all RelatedTasks, Labels, Attachments, and Assignees are properly populated in query results.

3. **Given** known UI bugs (404 on label creation, empty task detail view), **When** root causes are diagnosed and fixed, **Then** all UI workflows function identically to the original main branch.

**Phase 2: Complete the Refactor**
1. **Given** a stable codebase with working service patterns, **When** remaining features are refactored, **Then** all business logic is moved from models to services following established architectural patterns.

2. **Given** the refactoring backlog (Subscriptions, API Tokens, Notifications, etc.), **When** each feature is systematically refactored, **Then** each follows the same service-layer architecture and maintains backward compatibility.

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation**
1. **Given** a completed refactor, **When** automated test parity analysis is performed, **Then** no test cases or edge cases from the original system are lost.

2. **Given** a functional parity checklist of core user workflows, **When** executed on both original and refactored systems, **Then** behavior is identical across all workflows.

3. **Given** architectural review requirements, **When** final validation is performed, **Then** all business logic resides in services and all architectural principles are consistently applied.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when service layer changes break existing handler integrations?
- How does the system handle backward compatibility during the deprecation transition?
- What occurs if validation reveals functional differences between original and refactored systems?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Phase 1: System Stabilization Requirements**
- **FR-001**: System MUST achieve 100% passing backend test suite (`mage test:feature`) in development environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve all task-related query failures, ensuring complete data population for RelatedTasks, Labels, Attachments, and Assignees
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix the "404 Not Found" error occurring during label creation workflows in development environment
- **FR-004**: System MUST fix the "empty UI" issue in task detail view functionality in development environment
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain strict adherence to constitution.md principles and REFACTORING_GUIDE.md patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST demonstrate functional parity with vikunja_original_main reference implementation

**Phase 2: Complete Refactor Requirements**
- **FR-007**: System MUST refactor all remaining features from the analysis backlog (Subscriptions, API Tokens, Notifications, Saved Filters, Project Views, Link Sharing, Label-Task Management, User Data Export, Kanban Buckets, Bulk Task Update, Project-Team Permissions, Project-User Permissions, Labels, Reactions, Favorites, User Mentions) prioritized by dependency requirements first, then complexity (simplest first). **CRITICAL**: "Refactor" means MOVE business logic FROM models TO services, NOT duplicate logic in both layers. Model methods must delegate to services (deprecated wrapper pattern or dependency inversion pattern).
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement service layer for each feature following the established "Chef, Waiter, Pantry" architecture pattern. **CRITICAL**: Service layer contains ALL business logic (validation, business rules, database operations). Model layer either (a) uses deprecated methods that delegate to services, OR (b) uses dependency inversion pattern (function variables) to call service logic. NO business logic duplication between model and service layers.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use declarative routing and handler wrapper patterns for all new implementations
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement dependency inversion pattern for backward compatibility during model deprecation. **CRITICAL**: See T006 (User Mentions) as reference pattern - model has function variable pointing to service implementation, avoiding import cycles while delegating business logic.
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain consistent error handling and response patterns across all refactored services
- **FR-021**: System MUST verify architectural compliance before marking any task complete: (1) Model has NO business logic (`grep -c "s.Where\|s.Insert\|s.Delete" pkg/models/[feature].go` returns 0), (2) Model delegates to service (`grep -c "Service\|services.New" pkg/models/[feature].go` > 0 OR function variables used), (3) Routes call service layer (`grep -rn "[Feature]Service" pkg/routes/` finds service calls), (4) No logic duplication exists. If verification fails, create follow-up tasks (A: deprecate model, B: migrate routes, C: verify compliance).

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation Requirements**
- **FR-012**: System MUST execute automated test parity analysis comparing original test suites in vikunja_original_main with refactored tests in vikunja
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide functional parity checklist covering core user workflows (project creation, task management, user assignment, completion tracking, permissions, sharing, etc.)
- **FR-014**: System MUST execute manual validation of checklist workflows on both original and refactored applications, with original system behavior taking precedence when differences are discovered
- **FR-015**: System MUST complete architectural final review ensuring all business logic has been moved from models to services, conducted through AI analysis with human final approval
- **FR-016**: System MUST verify consistent application of all architectural principles across the entire codebase
- **FR-017**: System MUST achieve minimum test coverage requirements: 90% unit test coverage for refactored service layer components, 80% for other backend Go code, 70% for frontend components
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain API response time requirements: 95th percentile under 200ms for normal load

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Service Layer Architecture**: Complete implementation of the three-layer "Chef, Waiter, Pantry" pattern with services containing all business logic, handlers as thin glue layer, and models as data-only layer
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites with proper isolation, dependency injection, and coverage validation across model, service, and integration test layers
- **Validation Framework**: Systematic comparison and verification processes ensuring functional parity between original and refactored implementations
- **Refactor Backlog**: Cataloged features requiring service-layer implementation, prioritized by complexity and interdependencies
- **Quality Gates**: Defined checkpoints and criteria for phase completion, including test pass rates, performance benchmarks, and architectural compliance metrics
