## Quick Reference

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Current State | After T-PERMISSIONS |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Permission files in models | 20 files | 0 files |
| DB operations in models | Many | 0 |
| Mock services | 8 | 6 |
| Model test execution time | 1.0-1.3s | <100ms |
| Code reduction | - | ~1,700+ lines |
| Architectural purity | Mixed | 100% compliant |

### Effort Estimate

- **Conservative**: 12-15 days
- **Optimistic**: 8-10 days
- **Realistic with buffer**: 10-14 days

### Value Assessment

**Benefits** (Architectural):
- ✅ Pure POJO models
- ✅ Complete service layer pattern
- ✅ ~10x faster model tests
- ✅ ~1,700 lines of code removed
- ✅ Gold-standard Go architecture

**Costs** (Effort):
- ❌ 10-14 days of developer time
- ❌ Security-critical work (requires care)
- ❌ No immediate user-facing value
- ❌ Risk if rushed

---

## Decision Framework

### ✅ Execute T-PERMISSIONS If:
- Phase 3 validation is complete
- Team has 2-3 weeks of dedicated time
- Goal is architectural excellence
- Building foundation for years of development
- Technical debt elimination is priority
- Before next major version (v2.0)

### ❌ Defer T-PERMISSIONS If:
- Need to ship quickly
- Under deadline pressure
- Limited development capacity
- Current system works fine
- Short-term project focus
- Before Phase 3 validation complete

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 4.1.1: Preparation (1.5-2.5 days)
Create baseline tests and document dependencies
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-000, T-PERM-001
- **Critical**: Must establish behavior preservation tests first

### Phase 4.1.2: Infrastructure (1.5 days)
Build permission service foundation
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-002, T-PERM-003
- **Deliverable**: Permission delegation pattern established

### Phase 4.1.3: Helper Migration (2-3 days)
Move lookup functions to services
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-004, T-PERM-005
- **Can Parallelize**: Different files simultaneously

### Phase 4.1.4: Core Permissions (3-4 days)
Migrate Project, Task, Label, Kanban permissions
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-006, T-PERM-007, T-PERM-008, T-PERM-009
- **Foundation**: Required for all dependent entities

### Phase 4.1.5: Relations (2-3 days)
Migrate task and project relation permissions
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-010, T-PERM-011, T-PERM-012
- **Can Parallelize**: Multiple files simultaneously

### Phase 4.1.6: Cleanup (1-2 days)
Remove permission files and update documentation
- **Tasks**: T-PERM-013, T-PERM-014, T-PERM-015, T-PERM-016, T-PERM-017
- **Final**: Verification and completion report

## Files Affected

### Models (pkg/models/)
**Files to Delete** (20):
- All `*_permissions.go` files

**Files to Modify** (~15):
- Remove helper functions with DB operations
- Keep delegation stubs (or remove if desired)

### Services (pkg/services/)
**Files to Create**:
- `permissions.go` (new infrastructure)
- `permissions_baseline_test.go` (new baseline tests)

**Files to Modify** (~15):
- Add permission methods to existing services
- Add helper methods migrated from models

### Tests (pkg/models/, pkg/services/)
**Model Tests**: Convert to pure structure tests (no DB)
**Service Tests**: Add comprehensive permission tests

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- ✅ Zero `*_permissions.go` files in models
- ✅ Zero DB operations in model files
- ✅ All permission logic in services
- ✅ All baseline tests pass (behavior preserved)
- ✅ Full test suite passes (100% success)
- ✅ Model tests <100ms execution time
- ✅ Mock services reduced from 8 to 6

### Documentation
- ✅ REFACTORING_GUIDE.md updated
- ✅ Architecture docs updated
- ✅ Migration guide created
- ✅ Completion report generated

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Security Risk
- Create baseline tests BEFORE migration (T-PERM-000)
- Manual security review of all changes
- Compare with vikunja_original_main

### Scope Risk
- Strict scope: ONLY permission migration
- Task breakdown with clear deliverables
- Daily progress tracking

### Timeline Risk
- Conservative estimates with buffer
- Parallel execution where possible
- Stop/reassess if behind schedule

---

## Recommendation Summary

**For Production Release**: **DEFER**
- Complete Phase 3 validation first
- Ship with current permission pattern (works correctly)
- Revisit in 6-12 months

**For Architectural Excellence**: **EXECUTE AFTER PHASE 3**
- Allocate 2-3 weeks dedicated time
- Execute with careful attention to security
- Achieve gold-standard architecture

**Hybrid Approach**: **PHASED EXECUTION**
- Complete Phase 3 first
- Execute infrastructure + helpers (~5 days)
- Reassess and decide on remaining work

## Questions for Decision Maker

Before executing T-PERMISSIONS, answer these:

1. **Timeline**: Shipping quickly vs architectural perfection?
2. **Capacity**: Do we have 2-3 weeks of dedicated time?
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Comfortable with security-critical changes?
4. **Vision**: Foundation for years vs short-term project?
5. **Priority**: Technical debt elimination now vs later?
