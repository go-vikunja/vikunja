2. Repository URL using upstream instead of aroige fork (missing mcp-server/)
3. MCP build using pnpm instead of npm (package-lock.json vs pnpm-lock.yaml mismatch)
4. Service generation double-prefixing service_type ("vikunja-backend-blue" ‚Üí "backend")
5. Frontend URL auto-detection not configured (backend advertising 127.0.0.1:3456)
6. Nginx configuration issues (API proxy double-slash, WebSocket path, upgrade mapping)
7. User registration disabled (missing VIKUNJA_SERVICE_ENABLEREGISTRATION)
8. Database configuration hardcoded to SQLite (PostgreSQL/MySQL configuration not passed to service generation)

- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can run parallel with US1 BUT requires existing deployment to test
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs deployment to reconfigure)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs deployment to monitor)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs deployment to backup)

* US2 can be implemented in parallel with US1, but requires a deployment (from US1) to test updates
```

### Recommended Execution Order

**For MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
1. Phase 1: Setup
2. Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks everything)
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (Initial Deployment)
4. **STOP HERE** - You now have a working deployment system
5. Test, demo, validate with users

**For Full Feature Set**:
1. Complete MVP (Phases 1-3)
2. Phase 4: User Story 2 (Updates) - P1 priority
3. Phase 5: User Story 3 (Configuration) - P2 priority
4. Phase 6: User Story 4 (Monitoring) - P2 priority
5. Phase 7: User Story 5 (Backup) - P3 priority
6. Phase 8-10: Management commands, edge cases, documentation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phases**:
- All tasks marked [P] within a phase can run in parallel
- Setup tasks (T002-T006): All parallel
- Foundational library functions (T010-T016, T018): Can run in parallel
- Templates (T031-T034): Can run in parallel
- Integration tests: Can run in parallel after implementation

**Across User Stories** (if team capacity allows):
- After Foundation complete, US1, US2, US3, US4, US5 can be implemented by different developers
- However, US2-US5 need US1 for testing (requires actual deployment)
- Recommended: Complete US1 first, then parallelize US2-US5

**Documentation**:
- Phase 10 documentation (T113-T117, T122) can run in parallel with implementation

---

## Parallel Example: Foundation Phase

```bash
# After T009 (logging functions) complete, launch in parallel:
- T010: Progress indicators
- T011: Validation functions  
- T012: Privilege checks
- T014: Configuration management
- T015: State management
- T016: Error handling
- T018: Color codes

# After T017 (config template) complete:
- T031-T034: All templates in parallel
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Integration tests (can run in parallel, but may need deployment setup):
- T019: SQLite test
- T020: PostgreSQL test
- T021: Validation test

# Library functions (can run in parallel):
- T023: Proxmox CLI wrappers
- T024: LXC creation
- T025: Provisioning
- T026: Database setup
- T028: Systemd service creation
- T029: Nginx configuration
- T030: Health checks

# Templates (can run in parallel):
- T031: Backend systemd unit
- T032: MCP systemd unit
- T033: Nginx config
- T034: Health check script

# Main script (sequential - depends on library functions):
- T035 ‚Üí T036 ‚Üí T037 ‚Üí T038 ‚Üí T039 ‚Üí T040 ‚Üí T041 ‚Üí T042
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Goal**: Working deployment system in minimum time

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T018) - **CRITICAL PATH**
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T042)
4. **VALIDATE**: Run T019-T022 integration tests
5. **DEMO**: Deploy Vikunja to Proxmox in <10 minutes
6. **FEEDBACK**: Gather user feedback before proceeding

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 days

### Incremental Delivery

**After MVP**:
1. Add User Story 2 (Updates) ‚Üí **Value**: Zero-downtime updates
2. Add User Story 3 (Reconfigure) ‚Üí **Value**: Post-deployment flexibility
3. Add User Story 4 (Monitoring) ‚Üí **Value**: Operational visibility
4. Add User Story 5 (Backup) ‚Üí **Value**: Disaster recovery
5. Polish & Documentation ‚Üí **Value**: Production readiness

**Each increment**:
- Is independently testable
- Adds specific user value
- Can be deployed/demoed
- Builds on previous work

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 days

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundation (Phase 2) complete:

**Developer A**: User Story 1 (deployment) - 2-3 days
**Developer B**: Start documentation (Phase 10 docs) - ongoing
**Developer C**: Start User Story 2 (updates) - 2-3 days (needs US1 for testing)

Then continue with US3, US4, US5 in priority order.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing

**When**: After each user story phase completes
**How**: Run integration tests for that story
**Validate**: Independent test criteria from spec.md

**Test Execution**:
```bash
# User Story 1
cd deploy/proxmox/tests/integration
./test-fresh-install.sh
./test-postgresql-install.sh
./test-validation-errors.sh

# User Story 2
./test-update-cycle.sh
./test-rollback.sh
./test-migration.sh

# Continue for all user stories...
```

### Manual Testing

**When**: Before marking user story complete
**How**: Follow quickstart.md guide manually
**Validate**: All acceptance scenarios from spec.md pass

### CI Integration

**Setup**: Mock Proxmox API (deploy/proxmox/tests/fixtures/mock-proxmox-api.sh)
**Run**: Subset of integration tests that don't require real Proxmox
**Validate**: Script syntax (shellcheck), basic functionality

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 124
- Phase 1 (Setup): 8 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 10 tasks  
- Phase 3 (US1 - Deploy): 24 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Update): 19 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Reconfigure): 13 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Monitor): 15 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Backup): 14 tasks
- Phase 8 (Management): 6 tasks
- Phase 9 (Edge Cases): 6 tasks
- Phase 10 (Documentation): 12 tasks

**Parallel Tasks**: 76 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (61%)
**Critical Path**: Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phases 4-7 can parallelize

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (42 tasks, ~4-5 days)
**Full Feature**: All phases (124 tasks, ~8-12 days)

## Success Criteria Validation

Each user story maps to success criteria from spec.md:

- **US1 (Deploy)** ‚Üí SC-001: <10 min deployment, SC-008: 95% success rate
- **US2 (Update)** ‚Üí SC-002: <5 min update, SC-003: 99.9% uptime, SC-004: <2 min rollback
- **US3 (Reconfigure)** ‚Üí SC-009: <10 sec service interruption
- **US4 (Monitor)** ‚Üí SC-005: <10 sec health check, SC-010: Real-time feedback
- **US5 (Backup)** ‚Üí SC-006: <5 min backup, SC-007: 5 instances support

All tasks contribute to achieving these measurable outcomes.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no shared state, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Enable tracking which tasks belong to which user story
- **File paths**: Included in every task description for clarity
- **Integration tests**: Match the 5 user stories from spec.md
- **Checkpoints**: After each phase, validate story works independently
- **Dependencies**: Foundation blocks all stories; US1 required for US2-US5 testing
- **MVP strategy**: Phases 1-3 deliver working deployment system
- **Incremental**: Each story adds value without breaking previous work
- **Exit codes**: Follow contract in contracts/cli-interface.md (0-20 range)
- **Constitution**: Integration testing appropriate for infrastructure automation
