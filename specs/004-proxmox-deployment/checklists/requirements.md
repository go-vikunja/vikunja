# Specification Quality Checklist: Proxmox LXC Automated Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
✅ Specification focuses on what system should do for users, not how to implement
✅ All sections completed with concrete details from feature description
✅ Written for administrators deploying Vikunja, not developers implementing the solution
✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints, Risks) are present

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
✅ All 20 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "MUST provide single-command deployment", "MUST complete in under 5 minutes")
✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 10 minutes", "99.9% uptime", "zero dropped connections")
✅ Success criteria focus on user experience (deployment time, uptime, completion rates) rather than implementation
✅ All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
✅ 7 edge cases identified covering deployment failures, conflicts, and recovery scenarios
✅ Scope clearly defines what is included (LXC deployment, updates, backups) and excluded (Kubernetes, HA clustering, Let's Encrypt)
✅ Dependencies list external systems needed (Proxmox, Debian template, internet) and assumptions documented (root access, resources, DNS)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
✅ All functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
✅ 5 user stories prioritized (P1: deployment & updates, P2: configuration & monitoring, P3: backups)
✅ Success criteria are independently verifiable without knowing implementation (deployment time, uptime percentage, rollback time)
✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic except where required by Proxmox platform constraints

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT

The specification successfully:
1. Provides comprehensive deployment requirements without prescribing implementation details
2. Prioritizes user stories effectively (P1 for core deployment/update, P2 for operations, P3 for backup)
3. Defines measurable success criteria focused on administrator experience
4. Identifies realistic edge cases and mitigation strategies
5. Clearly bounds scope to Proxmox LXC deployment (excluding K8s, Docker, multi-node HA)
6. Documents all assumptions and dependencies needed for successful deployment

**Ready for Planning Phase**: YES

This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation roadmap. No clarifications needed.
