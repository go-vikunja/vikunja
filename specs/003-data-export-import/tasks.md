## Notes

- **Phase 1 is CRITICAL**: SQLite database import is the PRIMARY migration path
- After completing T001-T009 (Phase 1), you can migrate your production instance
- Tests should be written alongside implementation
- Documentation should be updated as implementation progresses
- Regular reviews should happen at end of each phase
- Integration tests should run after each phase completion

## Key Milestone: When Can You Import vikunja.db?

**Answer**: After completing **T006** (import-db CLI Command)

You will be able to run:
```bash
./vikunja import-db --sqlite-file=/path/to/vikunja.db --files-dir=/path/to/files
```

**Dependencies for this milestone**:
- T001: SQLiteImportService Core ✓
- T002: Data Transformation ✓
- T003: Transaction Management ✓
- T004: Files Migration ✓
- T005: Progress Reporting ✓
- T006: import-db CLI Command ✓

**Estimated Time to Milestone**: ~8.5 days (Week 1 + 1.5 days)

**Note**: T007-T009 (tests and docs) are important but not blocking for initial migration testing.
