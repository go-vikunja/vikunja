[ ] Repeating interval: As a user I want to be able to set a task to repeat only on Weekdays (Monday-Friday) or on weekends. Use the best UX and design decisions when planning this task. The frontend must be really nice and easy to use. Also, the API endpoints should support this, as well as the MCP-SERVER.

[ ] The Kanban views is broken after the service layer refactor. Compare to ../vikunja_original_main and try to figure out what broke, and fix the Kanban views.

[ ] Make it possible to select to include tasks from sub-projects when navigating to a project in the front end. The tasks from the sub-projects should clearly say which sub-project they belong to, like how it works in MLO (My Life Organized). Plan this feature with the best UX in mind. Also add this to the API endpoints in the best and standard way: include sub projects flag? Architect decides.
