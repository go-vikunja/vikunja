I have a new development task for you. The full description and requirements are located in the API_V2_TASKS.md file in the repository root. The PRD for the tasks are located in API_V2_PRD.md. Instructions on how to successfully build and run the tests are available in AGENTS.md.

## Task Summary:

[Paste a one or two-sentence summary of the task from tasks.md here. For example: "The goal is to add a new API endpoint /api/v1/status that returns the application's current version."]

## Your assignment:

1. **Read the api_v2API_V2_TASKS_tasks.md file** to get a complete understanding of the requirements.
2. **Explore the codebase** to identify all the files you'll need to modify.
3. **Propose a detailed, step-by-step plan** for implementing the solution. Your plan should include how you intend to test your changes.
4. If anything is unclear, please **ask for clarification** before you begin implementing the plan.

## Working with tasks

When working on a task from API_V2_TASKS.md, please follow these steps:

1.  **Implement the Endpoint:** Create the necessary route, handler, and any required business logic in the `pkg/` directory.
2.  **Write Tests:** Add unit and integration tests for the new endpoint. Ensure that all tests pass.
3.  **Ensure Feature Parity:** Refer to the corresponding v1 endpoint(s) to ensure that all functionality is replicated.
4.  **Update the API_V2_TASKS.md file:** Once the endpoint is fully implemented and tested, mark the corresponding task as completed by checking the box.

I'm ready to provide feedback on your plan or answer any questions you have.
