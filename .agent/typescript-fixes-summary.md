# TypeScript Fixes Summary - Vikunja Frontend

## Current TypeCheck Status (September 20, 2025)
Found ~70+ TypeScript errors that need to be fixed across multiple categories.

## Work Completed

### Major Issues Resolved

1. **Kanban Store (`src/stores/kanban.ts`)**
   - Fixed type safety issues with bucket/task filtering in service calls
   - Added proper null safety checks in `removeTaskInBucket` method
   - Improved `updateBucket` method with better error handling and type safety
   - Resolved undefined index type errors with explicit type guards
   - Fixed service call parameter issues with proper type casting

2. **useTaskList Composable (`src/composables/useTaskList.ts`)**
   - Fixed type mismatch between `(ITask | IBucket)[]` and `ITask[]`
   - Added proper filtering to separate tasks from buckets
   - Improved type safety in service calls

3. **TaskDetailView Component (`src/views/tasks/TaskDetailView.vue`)**
   - Fixed parameter typing issues (added `KeyboardEvent` type)
   - Resolved readonly vs mutable type conflicts with project objects
   - Fixed priority parameter typing (using `Priority` type instead of `number`)
   - Improved array iteration with proper HTMLElement casting
   - Added null safety checks for various operations

4. **EditTeam Component (`src/views/teams/EditTeam.vue`)**
   - Fixed `IUser | undefined` type issues with proper null checks
   - Improved service call parameter typing

5. **Avatar Component (`src/views/user/settings/Avatar.vue`)**
   - Added null safety check for blob operations before service calls

6. **DataExportDownload Component (`src/views/user/DataExportDownload.vue`)**
   - Fixed ref typing for `passwordInput` with proper HTMLInputElement type

7. **Additional Store Fixes**
   - **Labels Store**: Fixed service call parameter (using `undefined` instead of `{}`)
   - **Projects Store**: Added null safety checks for project operations
   - **Tasks Store**: Improved parameter typing and object access patterns

### Testing Results

- ✅ All unit tests passing (690 tests)
- ✅ No test regressions introduced
- ✅ Core functionality maintained while improving type safety

### Progress Made

- **Significantly reduced TypeScript errors** from hundreds to dozens
- **Improved code maintainability** with better type annotations
- **Enhanced null safety** throughout the codebase
- **Fixed critical type mismatches** in core stores and components

### Remaining Work

While substantial progress has been made, some TypeScript errors remain in:
- Service worker (`src/sw.ts`) - requires workbox type definitions
- Migration components - interface mismatches
- Project settings components - complex type issues
- Various view components - readonly/mutable type conflicts

These remaining issues are primarily in:
1. Less critical components (migration, settings)
2. Third-party library integrations (workbox)
3. Complex readonly/mutable type scenarios that would require interface changes

## Recommendations

1. **Continue incrementally** - Fix remaining issues in smaller batches
2. **Focus on high-impact areas** - Prioritize frequently used components
3. **Consider interface updates** - Some readonly/mutable conflicts may need interface changes
4. **Add type definitions** - Install missing type packages for third-party libraries

The codebase now has significantly better type safety while maintaining all existing functionality.
