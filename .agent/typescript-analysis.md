# TypeScript Issues Analysis

## Summary
The TypeScript check reveals approximately 800+ errors across the frontend. The issues fall into several categories:

## Major Categories of Issues

### 1. Readonly/Mutability Issues
- Projects and tasks from stores are readonly but components expect mutable types
- Need to fix interface compatibility between readonly store data and mutable component props
- Affects: AppHeader.vue, ProjectsNavigationItem.vue, General.vue

### 2. Null/Undefined Safety Issues
- Many properties marked as nullable in interfaces but accessed without null checks
- Missing null guards for `maxPermission`, `project`, `user` properties
- Undefined values being passed where non-null types expected

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- Implicit `any` types throughout codebase
- Missing type annotations on parameters and variables
- Generic type constraints not properly defined

### 4. Event Handler Type Issues
- Event parameters lacking proper typing
- Custom event properties not properly typed
- DOM event types not matching usage

### 5. Vue 3 Composition API Issues
- Template refs possibly null but accessed without checks
- Component refs with incorrect typing
- Props and emits not properly typed

### 6. API Integration Issues
- Model classes not matching interface expectations
- Service layer type mismatches
- Response data not properly typed

### 7. Library Compatibility Issues
- String methods not available in current target lib
- Date handling type mismatches
- Third-party component type issues

## Priority Fix Order

1. **High Priority**: Readonly/mutability fixes - affects core functionality
2. **High Priority**: Null safety - prevents runtime errors
3. **Medium Priority**: Implicit any types - improves type safety
4. **Medium Priority**: Event handler typing - improves developer experience
5. **Low Priority**: Library compatibility - may require config changes

## Next Steps

1. Fix readonly/mutability issues in core components
2. Add null guards and optional chaining
3. Add explicit type annotations
4. Update library target if needed
5. Test after each batch of fixes
