# API Documentation

You can find the api docs under `http://vikunja.tld/api/v1/docs` of your instance. 
A public instance is available on [try.vikunja.io](https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs).

These docs are autgenerated from annotations in the code with swagger.

The specification is hosted at `http://vikunja.tld/api/v1/docs.json`.
You can use this to embed it into other openapi compatible applications if you want.
