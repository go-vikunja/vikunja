  # Use pull_request_target instead of pull_request to get write access to GHCR
  # even for PRs from forks. This is safe because:
  # 1. We explicitly checkout the PR's head commit (no base branch code execution)
  # 2. We ONLY build a Docker image (isolated container, no workflow scripts from PR)
  # 3. No actions that execute PR code in the workflow context (no github-script, etc)
  # 4. Build happens in isolated Docker container with well-defined Dockerfile
  # This is the recommended pattern for building/publishing PR images from forks.
